# E-Commerce Product Catalog – Technical Assessment Write-Up

This project is a frontend web application built as part of a senior-level technical assessment. The goal was to create a simple and responsive e-commerce product catalog using a provided mock API. The application allows users to browse a grid of products, view product details, and manage a local shopping cart. It was built using React and Tailwind CSS, with API communication handled via Axios.

The project demonstrates a clear understanding of component-based design, API integration, and responsive styling. Products are fetched from the API and displayed in a clean grid layout. Each product can be clicked to view more information on a separate detail page. The app also includes bonus features such as category filtering and a local cart system using localStorage.

Key features implemented:

* Fetch and display product list from API
* Dynamic routing for individual product detail pages
* Local cart functionality with add and persist features
* Category filtering based on product metadata
* Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop
* Clean component structure for maintainability
* GitHub Pages deployment with public live link

Technologies used:

* React for frontend UI development
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* React Router for client-side routing
* Axios for HTTP requests
* Heroicons for UI icons
* LocalStorage for cart persistence

API endpoints used:

* GET /products – to retrieve all products
* GET /products/\:id – to retrieve individual product by ID

Deployment:

The app was deployed to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package. The build output was pushed to the `gh-pages` branch and is publicly accessible via the configured homepage URL.

This project showcases not only technical ability but also thoughtful UX, clean structure, and attention to detail in code organization. It fulfills all required features and includes optional enhancements to elevate the overall functionality.
